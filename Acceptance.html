    <center>Dear Valerie, after a careful and extensive review by the admissions committee of your friendship application that you submitted back in December under the Regular Decision titled "Why I should be Yale's friend", it is with the greatest enthusiasm that I write to you today to congratulate you on your acceptance to become Yale's friend! It only took you a little more than a year since we met. Great job! You have every reason to feel proud of your accomplishment. While granted that a huge part of it is the strong recommendation letter submitted by Ivy, it doesn't change the fact that you're awesome and you make so many people's lives at Stanford, including mine, better.</center>
    <br>
    <center>You're awesome Valerie. I hope you enjoy your day : )</center>
